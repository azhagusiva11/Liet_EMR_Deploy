I've uploaded my complete blood work with comparison data from 2022 - please refer to attached reports for all lab values.\nRecent Medical Event (8 days ago):\nFrom Thursday noon through the following Friday, I experienced a significant health episode. I had taken massive vitamin D supplements - 200,000 IU on Thursday, followed by another 100,000 IU Friday afternoon (total 300,000 IU in 36 hours, which is 75x normal dosage).\nInitially felt great Friday morning, but by Friday evening through Monday I experienced fatigue, cloudy mood, feverish feeling without actual fever, and reduced urination. Was even hallucinating during my first half marathon that Saturday. Symptoms resolved by Tuesday evening. Blood tests confirm vitamin D toxicity.\nTraining Background:\n\nRan 800km since January 2025, mostly treadmill\nCan confidently run 5km in 30 minutes daily\nCompleted first half marathon in 2:53 while experiencing the toxicity\n\n\nCurrent Status:\nNo cardiac symptoms, excellent exercise tolerance\nStopped smoking 2 months ago, stopped alcohol 10 days ago\n\nAttached lab reports \n",
